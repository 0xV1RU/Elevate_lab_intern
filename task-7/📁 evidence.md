**Extension Name:** _`Word to PDF Converter Pro`_

**Extension ID:** _`ddbmednkcaaciannkbjaineoecjkclfg`_

**Developer:** _`Unknown`_ (developer website link present but no transparency, may be risky)

**Permissions**: _Read and change all your data on the websites you visit_ — overly broad and dangerous.

**Issues:**
- Developer not verified by Google.
- No privacy policy or data handling disclosure.
- External site linked from developer field (potentially malicious).
- Users reported ads, redirection, and slow browser performance.
- VirusTotal scan didn't flag the website, but low reputation and no security transparency, reputation is questionable.

Action Taken:
✅ Removed extension to avoid privacy leaks, ad injection, and potential exploitation.
