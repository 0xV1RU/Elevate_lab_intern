**Extension Name:** _`Word to PDF Converter Pro`_

**Extension ID:** _`ddbmednkcaaciannkbjaineoecjkclfg`_

**Permissions**: _Read and change all your data on the websites you visit_ — overly broad and dangerous.

**Issues:**
- Developer not verified by Google.
- No privacy policy or data handling disclosure.
- External site linked from developer field (potentially malicious).
- Users reported ads, redirection, and slow browser performance.
- VirusTotal scan didn't flag the website, but low reputation and no security transparency, reputation is questionable.

### Review Code:
 Upon investigating the website linked to the “Word to PDF Converter Pro” extension, I discovered the following:
- No clear privacy or data usage policy for uploaded documents
- Suspicious ad injection via third-party scripts like storeads.io
- Fake prefilled email field (`fakeemail@fakeemail.com`) indicates bad coding practices

- No HTTPS security headers or file handling disclosures
- Attempts to monetize via shady key purchase links
- Potential data harvesting of sensitive Word, Excel, and PDF files

Due to these risks, the website and its associated Chrome extension should be considered unsafe and removed.
