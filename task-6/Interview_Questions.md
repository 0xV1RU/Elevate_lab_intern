1. **What makes a password strong?**  
   A strong password is long and uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. This increases entropy and makes it resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.

2. **What are common password attacks?**  
   Brute force, dictionary attacks, and phishing are most common. These methods try to guess or steal passwords using automation or social engineering.

3. **Why is password length important?**  
   Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of possible combinations. This makes brute-force attacks practically impossible within a short time.

4. **What is a dictionary attack?**  
   It’s an attack that tries passwords from a list of common or leaked words. Using real words makes passwords vulnerable to this type of attack.

5. **What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?**  
   MFA adds a second verification step like OTP or fingerprint along with password. Even if password is stolen, account stays protected.

6. **How do password managers help?**  
   They store and generate complex, unique passwords securely. This reduces the need to remember passwords and avoids reuse.

7. **What are passphrases?**  
   A passphrase is a long sequence of words or sentence used as a password. They're easier to remember but hard to guess due to length and randomness.

8. **What are common mistakes in password creation?**  
   Using short, simple, or personal info like name, DOB, or ‘123456’. Such passwords are easy targets for attackers using automated tools.
