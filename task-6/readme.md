## 🔐 Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation – Cybersecurity Internship
### 📌 Objective:
To understand what makes a password strong by creating multiple passwords, testing them using online password strength tools, analyzing the feedback, and summarizing best practices for secure password creation.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
- [Security.org Password Strength](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

### 🔑 Password Samples and Results:

| Password (masked)      | Strength Score | Tool Used              | Feedback Summary                         |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `password123`          | 43%            | PasswordMeter.com      | Too common, includes dictionary word     |
| `P@ssw0rd2024`         | 100%           | PasswordMeter.com      | Better structure but still predictable   |
| `Int3rn$hip!`          | 93%            | PasswordMeter.com      | Good: includes symbols, numbers, cases   |
| `S3cur3P@$$w0Rd!`      | 100%           | PasswordMeter.com      | Very strong: long, random phrase-based   |
| `H!@k3r_M!nd_789`      | 100%           | PasswordMeter.com      | Very strong: high complexity and length  |

### 📚 Key Learnings and Best Practices:

- ✅ Use ***at least 12 characters*** in passwords.
- ✅ Mix of ***uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols*** makes passwords stronger.
- ✅ Avoid using ***common phrases***, dictionary words, or personal details.
- ✅ ***Passphrases*** (e.g., `MyDog$Barks@Night2025`) are strong and easy to remember.
- ✅ Always ***enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*** for better protection.
- ✅ Use a ***password manager*** to store and generate secure passwords.

### 🧠 Common Password Attacks:
> #### 🔐 1. Brute Force Attack

  A brute force attack is a method used to gain unauthorized access to data by systematically trying every possible combination of passwords or keys until the correct one is found. This technique is often used to crack passwords and encryption keys, but it can be very time-consuming, especially with longer and more complex passwords.

***Prevention:***
- Use long passwords (12+ characters)
- Rate limiting or account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)

> #### 📚 2. Dictionary Attack

A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network or other IT resource by systematically entering every word in a dictionary, or word list, as a password. A dictionary attack can also be used in an attempt to find the key necessary to decrypt an encrypted message or document.

***Prevention:***
- Avoid using real words or common passwords
- Use random characters and mix upper/lowercase, symbols
- Regularly update passwords and monitor for breaches

> #### 🎣 3. Phishing Attack

Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim navigates the site, and bypasses any additional security boundaries by impersonating the victim.

***Prevention:***
- Always check URLs carefully
- Never click on unknown or suspicious links
- Use browser security alerts and anti-phishing tools
- Enable 2FA/MFA

### 🧾 Summary:

Through this task, I learned the key elements that make a password strong — including the importance of length, complexity, and randomness. By testing multiple passwords on online tools, I observed how different character combinations affect strength scores.

I also explored common password attacks like brute force, dictionary, and phishing, and understood how strong passwords and additional protections like MFA can prevent them.

Overall, this task enhanced my practical understanding of password security, its role in authentication, and best practices for safe password management in real-world scenarios.
